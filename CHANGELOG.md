## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The Windows binary is now built by the same compiler as the Linux and macOS
  ones. It is 3% larger (412 KB to 425 KB) — the new compiler generates
  slightly bigger code here. Checked on Windows 10: compressing a file gives a
  byte-identical result, files written by the previous binary still decompress
  to the original, and `unxz`, `xzcat`, `lzma`, `unlzma` and `lzcat` all work.

  It now uses the Universal C Runtime, which is part of Windows 10 and later.
  On Windows 7 or 8.1 that runtime has to be installed first — it comes through
  Windows Update. The previous binary did not need it.
